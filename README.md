# Candidate Search Application

This application allows employers to search for potential candidates using the GitHub API. It displays candidate information and allows users to save potential candidates for future reference.

## User Story

AS AN employer
I WANT a candidate search application
SO THAT I can hire the best candidates

## Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN the candidate search page loads, THEN the information for one candidate should be displayed, including the candidate's name, username, location, avatar, email, html_url, and company.
- WHEN I click the "+" button, THEN the candidate should be saved to the list of potential candidates and the next candidate's information should be displayed.
- WHEN I click the "-" button, THEN the next candidate's information should be displayed without saving the current candidate.
- WHEN there are no candidates available to review, THEN an appropriate message should be shown indicating no more candidates are available.
- WHEN the potential candidates page loads, THEN the user should see a list of previously saved potential candidates with their name, username, location, avatar, email, html_url, and company.
- WHEN the page reloads, THEN the list of potential candidates should persist and be available for viewing.
- WHEN there are no potential candidates, THEN an appropriate message should be displayed indicating no candidates have been accepted.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you're developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type-aware lint rules:

* Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property as follows:

```js
export default {
  // other rules...
  parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
  },
}
```

* Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` with `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`.
* Optionally, add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`.
* Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` and `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list.
